Software for creating storyboards and visual novels.
I originally made it for the story writers of a murder mystery visual novel. It was meant to make it easier for them to structurise the story, as well as make the data directly transferable to the project, thus making it easier for the programming team to implement.

## To-Do
- Fix the expression that calculates the position of new nodes
  - I found the line with the problem, and I have a general idea of whats wrong, just not exactly sure what to change
  - It's an expression with 4 variables that calculates some position
  - I have to figure out what variables have to be changed to their global equivalent
- Make a version for MacOS
  - Not sure why I haven't done this yet
- Remove every feature related to "clues" as it's not a universally needed feature.
  - The dedicated tab
  - Node that adds clues
  - Node that lets you use clues
